## Walkthrough
Below is a step-by-step flow of a new user's experience with the website. At the end of the bullet points, there will be the appropriate HTML file that the page refers to. 
### First Steps
- The user will be first directed to the feed page, where they can view the hottest posts. Because they are not signed in/registered yet, the posts they view will be very general and not tailored to the user yet (feed.html)
- The user can register/sign-in at the top right section of the page in the top navigation bar
### Register / Sign-in
- If the user chooses to register, they will have to upload a profile picture, a username, their email, and a password. (register.html)
- Once registered, the user can view posts that are tailored to them on the feed page
### Feed
- In the feed page, users can view posts in detail by clicking on the post's picture. (post.html)
- Users can also view the poster's profile page and follow them by clicking on their username (profile2.html)
### Creating a Post
- Users can create posts and their captions by clicking on the "New Post" button on the side bar (newPost.html)
- On this page, the user will need to upload a picture, and create a caption for the post
### Profile
- The user can navigate to the profile page through the button on the sidebar to view posts that they have saved, liked, commented on, and created. (profile.html)
- If the user wishes to edit their personal information, they can navigate to the edit profile page (edit-profile.html)
- Here, they can edit their username, email, password, bio, phone number, and profile picture
